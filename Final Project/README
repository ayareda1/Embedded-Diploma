#This Project is a simple model for SMART Home
at the Door the owner is asked to enter the password to be able to enter the house , the door won't be open until the owner enter the right password.
after entering the right password the door automatically opend and the lights of the home opens
for more security the owner is asked to enter anither password when he enter the house and if the passeword is incorrect a red led is ON and a Buzzer will be ON until the owner enters the correct password
also we have a fan which i controlled by a temperature sensor as if the temperature is higher than 40C the fan is ON otherwise it's OFF
